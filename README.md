Securities are negotiable financial instruments issued by a company or government
that give ownership rights, debt rights, or rights to buy, sell, or trade an option.
Securities are traded on the exchange markets.

Any broker or fund manager will talk about balance and diversification because we
want to manage risk. And they will also talk about asset allocation. First and
foremost, you have to determine your 1) ability to take risk, and 2) your
willingness to take risk.

So when we speak of diversification, we balance our investment portfolio into one
with 1) high-yielding but with higher risk, and 2) guaranteed, safe returns. This
means we have to divide between equities and bonds. Equities are stocks, mutual
funds, ETFs, index funds, and they have variable yields. Bonds are debt instruments
that guarantee interest rate like a time deposit but higher. Bonds usually have
lower yields compared to stocks.

Many say follow the age-based asset allocation formula. If your age is 25 then the 
allocation strategy is 75% stocks and 25% bonds. Some conservatives say 50/50.

When you retire at 65, you then shift your strategy to 35% stocks and 65% bonds. If
you have social security, then you survive on monthly social security payments and
possibly dividends from high capitalization stocks you invested on. You can withdraw
from time to time from investment funds to maintain liquidity and your quality of
life. But if you have a house or real estate and 401k then those are bonuses.

This is a good plan but not a perfect plan.

Past winners maybe today's losers.
